# AltSkins
A dynamic mod for loading skins in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl.

## Installation

### Automatic Installation
The easiest way to install AltSkins is to use the [Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/SlimeModManager/releases/latest).

### Manual Installation

*If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST!*
Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract `BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip` directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

This mod also requires Newtonsoft.JSON. You can download a copy of that [here](https://github.com/legoandmars/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/tag/12.0.3). Simply extract to the game's root folder.

Then, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/legoandmars/AltSkins/releases/latest) and extract the zip in your game's root folder.

##  Using skins

[Slime Mod Manager](https://github.com/legoandmars/SlimeModManager/releases/latest) has a list of skins, allowing you to easily select skins you want and install them all with one click.

You can install also manually skins from [Thunderstore](https://nasb.thunderstore.io/) (Preferred), [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/games/12837) (Legacy), or another source by placing the `.nasbskin` file into your `BepInEx/Skins` folder.

## Creating skins
Creating `.nasbskin` files is made very easy with the help of `AltSkinEditor`, an editor with the following features:

- Automatically extraction of character textures and portraits
- Easy support for swapping out any texture used on a character
- Support for providing a custom profile image on a skin
- Package generation for uploading your skin to Thunderstore easily
